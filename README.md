Task Specifications:
-------------------

Using Ruby build a command line chatbot, along the Maker's guidelines, that can have a conversation with you.

Personal Additions:
------------------

I also gave the bot the ability to learn new responses. If it doesn't know what your asking it, it will ask you to input what you want it to respond in future. I am particularly proud of this addition as it makes the whole interaction so much smoother. Because any additions are saved on exit, the bot can keep learning and come across more coherently with each use.
